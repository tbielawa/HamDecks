FINAL POOL RELEASE – MARCH 1,2011
( correction to reflect correct answer to G7A03 per errata )
Issued by the NCVEC QPC - February 23, 2011
Edits and Corrections to the General Class, Element 3 Pool
Released December 6, 2010 to be effective July 1, 2011- June 30, 2015
We have received feedback via the NCVEC website and through direct communications pointing out minor errors and suggesting clarifications for the 2011 General Class Pool just released.  The QPC has reviewed all of these comments, and is now issuing the attached minor edits and clarifications to the pool. Note that a minor error in the schematic was corrected as well.  
The schematic error did not affect any of the associated questions. Also, note that one question has been withdrawn as, on reconsideration, we felt it was confusing and of limited relevance.  The other changes were corrections to remove minor typos,improve rules citations, and clarify questions. 
Thanks to all who provided feedback, and to the committee who worked on these changes so diligently.
  
1. Question G0A06 is being withdrawn due to lack of clarity and limited relevance.
2. Figure G7-1 is replaced to correct schematic error in which the varactor diode (item 4) was shown reversed.  (See new G7-1 files on the website: www.ncvec.org for download.) 

3. G1B03:  Correct typo in rule citation.  Change 97.1 (a)(9) to read 97.3 (a)(9) 

4. G1C04: Clarification.  Reword question: Which of the following is a limitation on transmitter power on the 14 MHz band?

6. G1C06: Clarification.  Reword question: Which of the following is a limitation on transmitter power on the 1.8 MHz band?

7. G1D01:  Rule reference as shown is incomplete.  Change 97.119 to 97.119(f)(2)

2011-2015 Element 3 General Class Question Pool 
Original Release - December 6,2010 – Revised as of February 23,2011
This is the official release of the 2011 General Class (Element 3) Question pool from the Question Pool Committee of the NCVEC

This file is available on the ncvec.org website in PDF (Portable Document Format), Microsoft Word .DOC format, and .TXT format.  Section G7A requires the use of one illustration, a schematic drawing identified as G7-1.  Note that the figure for the 2011 pool differs from that of the previous pool. This drawing file is published separately and is available in raw JPEG and PDF format on the ncvec.org website. 

As always, VECs are free to correct minor typographical and punctuation errors,including obvious minor omissions. Such corrections must not cause a change in the meaning of a question or any of the proposed answers to that question. Also, since rule citation references are not part of the question itself, but are included only to assist instructors and students when looking up the applicable section of the rules, errors in the reference identifiers are not considered adequate reason for removal of a question from the pool. 

I wish to thank the committee members for their long hours and dedication to this task, and especially to thank Nancy Hallas, W1NCY, for her invaluable editorial assistance and Jim Nowotarski, N3GOO, for his assistance in drafting the figure.
